# Installing AOS

For someone installing AOS on a machine of their own, from a release.
About twenty minutes, most of it the copy.

## Will it run here?

Before writing a stick, on the machine as it is now, under any Linux:

```sh
sh aos-check.sh
```

([br2ext/board/aos/aos-check.sh](../board/aos/aos-check.sh), nothing to
install.) It prints a verdict per item -- the CPU level, firmware and
Secure Boot, the GPU against the NVIDIA rule, which driver this Linux
uses for the Wi-Fi, sound and Bluetooth -- and writes
`~/aos-check-<host>-<date>.txt` to send with a bug report. A NO stops
AOS; a CHECK is something to look at in [known-issues.md](known-issues.md).

## What you need

- A 64-bit PC from about 2012 on (the CPU must support x86-64-v2; a Core
  2 or older will not boot it). Intel or AMD graphics work out of the box;
  NVIDIA cards from the RTX 20 series on use NVIDIA's open driver.
- A USB stick of 2 GB or more, for the installer. It is erased.
- A disk of at least 16 GB to install onto. **It is erased completely.**
  AOS does not share a disk with another system yet.
- Secure Boot turned **off** in the firmware settings. Nothing AOS ships
  is signed for it (see [policies.md](policies.md)).

## 1. Get the release and check it

From the release page, download `aos-<version>-x86_64.iso`, `SHA256SUMS`,
`SHA256SUMS.minisig` and the publisher's key, `apm.pub` (key id
`CA2811A314D6EB0C`). Then:

```sh
minisign -Vm SHA256SUMS -p apm.pub        # "Signature and comment signature verified"
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS  # "aos-<version>-x86_64.iso: OK"
```

If either fails, do not use the file.

## 2. Make the installer stick

On Linux, with the stick at `/dev/sdX` (check with `lsblk`; the wrong
letter erases the wrong disk):

```sh
sudo dd if=aos-<version>-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M conv=fsync status=progress
```

On Windows or macOS, any tool that writes a raw image works (Rufus in
"DD image" mode, balenaEtcher).

## 3. Boot it

1. Power the machine fully off -- not a restart.
2. Put the stick in a USB port on the machine itself, not a hub.
3. Power on and open the one-time boot menu: Esc or F8 on ASUS, F12 on
   Dell and Lenovo, F9 on HP, Option on a Mac.
4. Pick the stick's **UEFI** entry. GRUB shows a menu; the first entry
   starts AOS. If the firmware does not list the stick at all, see
   [known-issues.md](known-issues.md) -- some refuse an ISO written to a
   stick.

The live desktop runs as `admin`, an account with no password: sudo asks
for none there, and there is no lock screen, because whoever sits at a
live stick owns the machine.
Nothing on your disk is touched until you install.

If the screen goes black after GRUB, restart and pick "AOS (live, safe
graphics, no GPU driver)": it leaves the GPU driver out, which is the way in on hardware
whose driver misbehaves. Please report it ([known-issues.md](known-issues.md)
says how).

## 4. Install

Press the Super key (the one with the Windows logo) and pick **Install
AOS**:

1. **Keyboard**: your layout, for the desktop and the console.
2. **Time zone**.
3. **Account**: your user name and password. This account owns the
   machine and is its administrator; the demo account is not installed,
   and root cannot log in on the console.
4. **Disk**: the disk to install onto. The stick you started from is never
   offered. Everything on the chosen disk is erased.
5. **Install**: "Encrypt the disk", if you want it, locks your files,
   programs and settings with your password, which is then asked for at
   every start, before the desktop. Then a progress bar, then
   **Restart**. Remove the stick when the machine turns off.

The installed machine starts at a login screen with your account.

A machine installed for someone else (`aos-install --oobe`, or a stick
made with `./usb.sh --oobe`) asks the same questions at its first boot
instead, without the disk, and the desktop restarts as the new owner.

## 5. After the install

- **Wi-Fi, sound, displays, Bluetooth, users**: the Settings
  application.
- **Software**: Super, then Software -- AOS's own applications under
  Official, and Visual Studio Code, Firefox, Discord and Steam under
  Third-party once you switch that repository on (they are not part of
  AOS, and are marked).
- **Updates**: AOS looks once a day and says so when there are some.
  Software -> Update installs every application update and a new AOS in
  one step; a new AOS starts at the next restart, and the boot menu's "AOS
  (previous version)" goes back to the one before if anything is wrong.
- **Screenshots**: Print (the display), Shift+Print (the window); they
  are in Pictures/Screenshots.
- **Glass or not**: Settings -> Display -> Appearance. Lightweight is
  opaque and easiest on a slow GPU.

## If something goes wrong

Settings -> About -> **Save Report** writes one file with everything a
bug report needs (the journal, the hardware, what is installed). Without
a desktop, log in on the console and run `sudo aos-report`.
