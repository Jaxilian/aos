# Known issues

What does not work yet, or works only partly, in the current alpha. Each
entry says what to do about it today. A problem that is not here: Settings
-> About -> Save Report, and send the file with a description to the
address in [../../SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) (security problems) or as
an issue on the project.

## Installing

- **Secure Boot must be off.** Nothing is signed for it; a machine with it
  on will not start the installer. Decided, not planned
  ([policies.md](policies.md)).
- **Some firmware will not boot the ISO from a stick.** The image is a
  hybrid ISO; most UEFI firmware lists it, but some (seen: the AMI firmware
  of an ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14) does not. Workaround on a Linux machine:
  `./usb.sh` from the source tree installs AOS onto the stick as an
  ordinary system, which every firmware boots ([usb.md](usb.md)).
- **The whole disk is used.** No dual boot, no installing beside another
  system, no choosing partitions.
- **A forgotten password is the files gone.** Every home is encrypted
  with its account's password (systemd-homed); the recovery key shown
  once at the first boot is the only other way in. Programs, settings
  and logs are in the clear unless "Also encrypt the whole disk" was on
  at install (`aos-install --encrypt`), which adds a passphrase asked at
  every start, before the desktop ([policies.md](policies.md)).
- **A machine installed before 0.3 keeps its classic account**, with a
  plain home: it updates and works, and nothing converts the home.
  Reinstall for an encrypted one. Settings → Accounts can make new,
  encrypted accounts on it.
- **A home is not resized.** homed gives the owner most of the free
  space of the aos partition, sparse on the disk; what a second account
  made in Settings gets is the same default. Shrinking or growing one
  afterwards is homectl's job on a terminal.
- **The live session's account, `admin`, has no password**: sudo asks for
  none, and there is no lock screen. It exists only on
  the installer; an installed machine has only the account you create.

## Hardware

- **One laptop has been tested**, an ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (2026, Intel
  Panther Lake, NVIDIA RTX 5070). Everything else is untested; reports are
  what makes the compatibility list.
- **Sound** works on the G14's SoundWire (Intel's DSP with Cirrus
  amplifiers) and on HDA in testing.
- **Bluetooth** works on the G14 (Intel BE201, on PCIe): Settings sees the
  adapter and the devices around. Pairing has no agent yet, so a keyboard
  that wants a passkey typed cannot pair.
- **Suspend and lid close** work on the G14, and the screen locks before
  sleep. A lock screen that lost the keyboard after a resume (when the
  brightness display was up) is fixed in 0.2.8, not yet confirmed on the
  G14.
- **A port wired to the NVIDIA GPU** (the G14's HDMI) shows nothing: the
  desktop draws on one GPU and drives only its outputs. Planned, and big.
- **A display plugged back in** stayed black, without its bar, before
  0.2.8; fixed, not yet confirmed on hardware.
- **NVIDIA**: RTX 20 series and newer only (the open kernel modules); games
  through Proton have run on the Intel GPU, not yet on the NVIDIA one.

## Desktop

- **Glass shows only the wallpaper through a window**, never the windows
  behind it -- the cheap kind of blur, chosen so it runs on an integrated
  GPU. Settings -> Display -> Appearance -> Lightweight turns it off.
- **A new theme reaches an application when it next starts**; the desktop
  itself follows within seconds.
- **No drag and drop between applications** yet. (Screenshots: Print for
  the display, Shift+Print for the window, Super+Shift+S without a Print
  key; they land in Pictures/Screenshots.)
- **Window controls**: the three lights at the top right of every
  window are the desktop's (0.3.2). A program that draws no title bar
  of its own (Blender, Spotify, X11 programs) gets a whole one from the
  desktop and resizes from a narrow band at its edges, with no resize
  cursor yet and no highlight when the pointer is over a light. One
  that draws its own bar whole (Firefox, Chrome, Steam) keeps it.
- **X11 programs** need XWayland, a third-party package (Software ->
  AOS -> Compatibility); Steam installs it.

## Software

- **The app store's catalogue is small**: AOS's own applications, and
  Visual Studio Code, Firefox, Chrome, Discord, Spotify, Steam, Lutris,
  Blender, Krita and Inkscape as third-party.
- **Third-party packages are not part of AOS** and may break with an
  update of either; they are marked wherever they appear.
- **Firefox may show pages as boxes** on some machines (its sandbox and the
  fonts); fixed in testing, not yet confirmed on hardware.
- **Firefox and Discord now live in a home of their own** (`~/.var/app/`,
  see [security-model.md](security-model.md)); a profile or login made
  by an earlier release stays in `~/.mozilla` or `~/.config/discord` and
  is not carried over. Downloads is shared, so what they saved there is
  where it was. A file dialog inside them shows their own home.

## Updates

- **A machine installed before 0.2.0** cannot update to 0.2.x: its
  updater knows only the old root slots ([layout.md](layout.md)).
  Reinstall it, once.
- **An update replaces the system, not a part of it**: about 750 MB per
  release. Delta updates are not planned before 1.0.
- **Every release reaches a machine as it is published** unless
  Software -> Update -> "Follow the stable channel" is on; the stable
  channel is filled by hand, after a release's time on edge, and is
  empty until the first promotion.
- **AOS's own applications show as installed in Software but do not
  upgrade one by one**: they are part of the release image, and a new
  version of one comes with the next system update.

## Security status

The CVE report of each release and what was done about every entry:
[security-status.md](security-status.md). What AOS defends against and
what it does not yet -- AOS's own applications are not sandboxed (third-party
ones are), Secure Boot is unsupported, a machine installed before 0.3
has a classic home in the clear: [security-model.md](security-model.md).
